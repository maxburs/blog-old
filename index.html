            <p>Hello, this is Maxwell Burson</p>
            <p>I am Junior Front End Web Developer, soon to be Full Stack Developer. My time is currently spent looking for my first industry position and broadening my skill set by working through web based curriculum.</p>
            <p>My last milestone was finishing the Front End Development section of Free Code Camp. My current progress with that program can be seen at freecodecamp.com/maxwellburson. Online exercises are reinforced with computer science classes I have taken from Allen Hancock College.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for an affable, self motivated developer, be sure to take a look.</p>
